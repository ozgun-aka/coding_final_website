        <h2>How Building Information Modelling Facilitates the Creation of Green Cities</h2>
        <p>
          In today’s rapidly urbanizing world, the need for sustainable development has become more urgent than ever. 
          Green cities, which aim to minimize environmental impact and promote a high quality of life, are a key part 
          of this vision. One of the most powerful tools for achieving green urban environments is Building Information 
          Modelling (BIM). BIM is a digital process that enables architects, engineers, and planners to design, simulate, 
          and manage buildings and infrastructure efficiently. It plays a crucial role in creating smart, sustainable, 
          and energy-efficient cities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, BIM allows for more accurate and integrated planning. In a green city, every building must be designed 
          with energy efficiency, environmental impact, and resource use in mind. BIM supports this by providing 
          <span class="highlight-wrapper" data-photo="photo1">
            <span class="highlight-text">
              detailed 3D models that include data about materials, energy use, water systems…
            </span>
          </span> 
          This helps project teams make better design decisions early in the process, reducing waste and optimizing resource consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, BIM promotes collaboration across different disciplines. Green city projects require input from various 
          professionals: urban planners, civil engineers, environmental consultants, and facility managers. BIM serves as a 
          shared platform where all stakeholders can work together in real-time, identifying problems early and avoiding 
          costly mistakes. This integrated approach results in more sustainable outcomes and faster project delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another major advantage is lifecycle analysis. BIM is not just for design and construction—it also supports 
          maintenance and operation. By using BIM, city planners can predict a building’s performance over time, track 
          energy consumption, and schedule efficient maintenance. This long-term perspective is essential for green cities, 
          where sustainability must be maintained for decades.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, BIM enables simulations such as 
          <span class="highlight-wrapper" data-photo="photo2">
            <span class="highlight-text">
              daylight analysis, airflow modeling, and energy efficiency tests
            </span>
          </span> 
          before a single brick is laid. These features allow designers to optimize natural lighting, ventilation, and thermal 
          performance—reducing the need for artificial heating, cooling, and lighting.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, Building Information Modelling is not only transforming the way buildings are designed and 
          constructed, but also playing a vital role in shaping the green cities of the future. By improving planning, 
          enhancing collaboration, and enabling long-term sustainability, BIM makes it easier to create cities that are 
          environmentally responsible, economically efficient, and livable for generations to come.
